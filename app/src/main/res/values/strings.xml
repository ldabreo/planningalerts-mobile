    <string name="about_text">You\'d probably know if your next door neighbour was going to knock their house down (you\'d get a letter through the door telling you they had
        applied for planning permission and asking you what you thought about it). But you\'d probably never find out if the old cinema or pub 5 streets
        away is going to be converted into luxury flats until the bulldozers turned up.
        \n\nPlanningAlerts mobile is a free app that uses the data provided by PlanningAlerts to map details of development applications near you.
        The aim of this to enable shared scrutiny of what is being built (and knocked down) in peoples\' communities.
        \n\nPlanningAlerts Mobile is brought to you by L.D\'Abreo, made possible by PlanningAlerts which is run by the charity
        <a href="https://www.oaf.org.au/">OpenAustralia Foundation</a>

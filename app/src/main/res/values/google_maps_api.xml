    Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=27:39:F9:E1:A1:A0:CA:FE:A3:C3:75:30:2D:8E:87:F4:63:7F:57:E5%3Bplanningalerts.com.ausamplemap

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    27:39:F9:E1:A1:A0:CA:FE:A3:C3:75:30:2D:8E:87:F4:63:7F:57:E5

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    27:39:F9:E1:A1:A0:CA:FE:A3:C3:75:30:2D:8E:87:F4:63:7F:57:E5

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Note the keys are not included in the source for this project and you must supply these at build time -
    this is to prevent them from being misappropriated.

    To add the key for google mobile maps, places and geocoding:

    Edit your gradle.properties file under your user's home directory /.gradle

    Add the entry:

    google_google_maps_key="Your key"
    -->

    <string name="google_geocoding_url" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json</string>
    <string name="google_geocoding_connecttimeout" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">5000</string>
    <string name="google_geocoding_readtimeout" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">5000</string>
